## Tooling

Install:
- https://docs.docker.com/install/
- https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
- https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind
- https://docs.fluxcd.io/en/latest/references/fluxctl.html

```
kind --version   # Should yield at least 0.6.0
docker ps        # Should not give any errors
kubectl version  # Should at least give application version
#
docker pull kindest/node:v1.16.3
fluxctl identity --k8s-fwd-ns flux
fluxctl sync --k8s-fwd-ns flux
```
---

# Create cluster

```
# Create the cluster
kind create cluster
# Just test that it runs OK
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl config get-contexts
kubectl config use-context kind-kind  
```
---
# ...  and enable GitOps with kustomize

https://docs.fluxcd.io/en/latest/tutorials/get-started-kustomize.html
```
mkdir fluxcd
# ... follow instructions

```

## GitOps

- Often mentioned as part of a CD / CI toolchain
- git repository is the source of truth for a systemâ€™s configuration,
- configuration as code https://rollout.io/blog/configuration-as-code-everything-need-know/
- when the actual state of the system drifts from the desired state.
  - k8s good fit

Argo-flux collaberation
- https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/
- Effectively merging Flux and ArgoCD into a single solution is a long term goal: https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/blob/master/specs/design.md
